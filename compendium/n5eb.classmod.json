			"description": "<p>CURSED SEAL</p><p>Gaining the Cursed seal is a controversial event. From a bygone era of dark ninjutsu and experimentation, this relic of history has survived this long as a testament to the twisted nature of the people who study and employ them. Characters who are afflicted with a curse seal are usually targets of dark shinobi, twisted scientists or corrupt figures who wish to use them in a plot to convert them over to their side. In some cases, they are guided to a certain decisions and forced to make it against their better judgement.</p><p>Cursed seals are powerful Fuinjutsu that cannot be removed by normal means. Those with these marks are generally under the command, dominion or even patronage of a powerful figure, similar to that of Orochimaru. Players who find themselves sporting a cursed seal are not looked at with eyes of envy or even joy. A cursed seal can lead to banishment, torture, and in some cases death by association. This isn’t a marking that most villages would allow to freely roam around without close supervision or excessive amounts of trust.</p><p>The Cursed seal is a tool that can be used for plot relevance from the side of the DM and mechanical benefit of the Player. When granted to the player, the Curse Seal immediately takes hold and grants the creator of it a direct line of influence over them and granting them power to overcome almost insurmountable trials they may be facing at that particular moment in time. This is a powerful Class Mod and should not be handed out freely without careful consideration into enemy choice.</p><p></p><p>GAINING A CURSED SEAL</p><p>The Curse Seal cannot be learned or found, it cannot be self-imposed and is always given to the player by hostile or less than friendly means. In most cases when the Curse seal is applied to the player it is in a conflict of some sort with the Cursed seals current master or creator. The Curse seal is a powerful asset and is generally handed out only at points when the Villain both wants to influence a particular player, the characters are entering a point in time where they are getting slight bumps in their power &amp; the DM wants to include a level of Risk and reward in regards to how a character goes about getting stronger at a cost. Generally, there is not a save associated with receiving a Cursed seal and should not be. The only case in which a saving throw should be made should be to resist passing out after it initially takes hold.</p><p>The application of a Curse seal should always take place during a point in time when its most makes sense to introduce such variable power ups in the game. Once you gain the Cursed Seal, it’s influence tears its way into your mind and its influence spreads throughout your body, slightly corroding it.</p><p></p><p>LEVELING UP THE CURSED SEAL</p><p>Leveling up a Curse Seal is an arduous task, unlike normal ninja classes that require the player to gain XP to reach their next level, the curse seal requires a sacrifice of some sort on the player's behalf. This must come willingly and cannot be forced by a 3rd party. A creature cannot charm another creature into willingly advancing to the next level.</p><p>By permanently gaining a rank of Corruption you permanently increase your Cursed Chakra pool. Each Level of the Cursed Seal requires more ranks of Corruption, relying on the player to offer up more and more of their body and stamina to the Curse seal to receive more and more of its benefits. Corruption cannot be removed, by any means.</p><p>When the Curse seal is advanced in level, the player who did so, gains access to the new levels features. The Cursed Seal can only be advanced via player action and is not automatic in any way.</p><p>Some Corruption effects, and even Cursed seal Features will reference your Cursed Seal patron DC. You can calculate this DC using the following;</p><p>Cursed Seal Patron DC: 5 + Current Rank of Corruption.</p><img src=\"systems/n5eb/assets/Icons%20%26%20Images/Cheat%20Sheet/Corruption.png\" /><img src=\"systems/n5eb/assets/Icons%20%26%20Images/Cheat%20Sheet/Cursed%20Seal.png\" />"

			"description": "<p>Unlocking the power of the Mangekyō Sharingan is not something to envy. When you see a Mangekyō Sharingan it is the result of trauma suffered for a second time but to a greater degree. It has long been thought that the owner of the Mangekyō needed to kill their closest friend, creating a twisted state of thought for many years. This has since been raised out of the minds of current Uchiha, while most of the text still remains it is noted as being inaccurate. But this does not always work unfortunately.</p><p>This Mangekyō Sharingan is a powerful evolutionary Dojutsu that has the power to bend the rules of Chakra and the world around the user to its whims. The Mangekyō Manifests a series of abilities, usually unique to the user in either eye, and once a user has reached the peak of power, they tend to unlock a 3rd, ultimate Mangekyō Art.</p><p>The Mangekyō Sharingan is a tool that can be used for both plot &amp; Mechanical relevance. Both the GM and the Player can benefit from including this into the narrative.</p><p>The Mangekyō Sharingan has been designed to fit into any story. The Mangekyō Sharingan is a mid to late game class mod that, if used, should come with moderation and consideration for other players and keeping balance with Power levels. This class mod Should only be gained by characters who have all 3 tomes of the Sharingan, which is normally gained at level 11. While this is a powerful Class Mod and should not be handed out freely without careful consideration into enemy choice.</p><p>GAINING THE MANGEKYŌ SHARINGAN</p><p>Gaining the Mangekyō Sharingan should always be a struggle and filled with trials and tribulations. This Advancement and power is not something that should come easy, or should be planned for, their power should only come as the result of a major emotionally traumatic event in the characters life. As there is no direct path to attaining it, the decision for when it’s unlocked is wholly in the hands of the GM and/or players as they build the world. While there are no hard-set rules around unlocking it, it can prove difficult to come up with something on the fly. There will be a few different options that can be set up by the GM. While this list will include options, it should not be taken as the only possible options and GM’s are encouraged to work with Players to find a system they want to use to unlock this.</p><p>LEVELING UP THE MANGEKYŌ SHARINGAN</p><p>Leveling up the Mangekyō Sharingan (MS) is a difficult task, unlike normal shinobi classes that require the player to gain XP to reach their next level, the MS requires the user to consistently use it, train it, and master its power. But the more the Eye is used, the greater the risk of losing the Light of the Sharingan permanently. This risk comes into play each time the player makes use of this power. The MS requires the player to make a significant commitment to using the power of the Dojutsu.</p><p>By spending time training with the MS in short bursts, the user can reliably increase their proficiency with their MS with little risk. Alternatively by aggressively giving into their Hatred, they can forcibly progress their MS at a much faster rate than normal. But this comes at the risk of losing themselves to the curse of the Uchiha, also known as Uchiha Madness, Sharingan Psychosis and The Curse of Hatred.</p><p>When you gain this class mod, you and the GM decides on which path your character is following to grow their MS. This choice should not be changed later primarily to maintain narrative consistency. The risk of using both systems interchangeably is that it can be manipulated to a cunning player attempting to game the system.</p><p>TRAINING AND EFFORT</p><p>If following the training method, at each of the listed character level minimum requirements found on the Mangekyō Sharingan class mod table on the following page, in order to progress to the next level, characters must spend 20 downtime exclusively training their MS to progress to the next level.</p><p>HATRED AND MALICE</p><p>If following the path of escalating hatred, characters must have a set of other creatures, concepts or ideas that they hate with unrivaled loathing. So much so that encountering it sends their characters into a self-imposed seething rage. These chosen creatures, concepts or ideas must be connected in some way either directly or loosely (Ex. Sasuke’s Hatred began with his brother Itachi and then extended to Danzo, and then the Leaf Village and then the structure of Shinobi.).</p><p>Following this path you must actively kill or destroy each of these things as they present themselves to you crushing everything in your path in order to level up to the next level of this class mod. The GM and player should work together to enable the MS user to level up at a similar pace to other class mod users in the party if following this path.</p><p>LIGHT &amp; DARKNESS OF THE MANGEKYŌ SHARINGAN</p><p>When you first gain access to the Mangekyō Sharingan, your eye forms and you develop a unique power generally unique to you and most other Mangekyō Sharingan users known as a Mangekyō Art. Utilization of these Arts drains a limited resource known as Light from ones Sharingan. Light, unlike other class mod resources does not regenerate and once lost, is permanently gone. The MS user who uses this class mod to the point of reaching 0 Light becomes permanently blind and loses both their Sharingan clan feature and this class mod.</p><p>If you would gain the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan you can no longer lose Light. You instead can only gain Darkness. If you would gain 200 Darkness, you lose yourself to this Darkness as the Uchiha’s curse takes over your mind as you becomes blinded by revenge and power. This causes your character to effectively becomes functionally an NPC and a villain within your current or future narrative.</p><img src=\"systems/n5eb/assets/Icons%20%26%20Images/Cheat%20Sheet/Mangekyo%20Sharingan%20Unlock%20Ideas.png\" /><img src=\"systems/n5eb/assets/Icons%20%26%20Images/Cheat%20Sheet/Mangekyo%20Sharingan.png\" />"

			"description": "<p>SENJUTSU SAGE MODE</p><p>Unlocking the power of Senjutsu is a normally unheard- of feat. The power to harness the worlds naturally</p><p>occurring energy supply is a monstrously difficult task and not to be taken lightly in any sense of the word. Senjutsu involves the process of drawing natural energy into one’s self and blending it with their own chakra to create Sage Chakra. Those who have undergone the challenges presented when learning to harness such a power have come out in one of two ways; Either dead or with the power of a Sage. Sages are usually the bearers of change. The protectors of the natural order. They are usually the ones standing in between disaster and peace in most eras of shinobi history. Senjutsu is a powerful tool that can be used for both plot &amp; mechanical relevance. Both the GM and the player can benefit from including this into the narrative. Senjutsu has been designed to fit into any story. Senjutsu is a High-powered class mod, so if providing players, the option to gain it, take into consideration what Class Mods are provided to other players. Due to the amount of power Sage Mode provides it is not intended to be used by characters who are below 11th level. Characters who gain this powerful class mod, should only do so after arduous training with narrative purpose behind it.</p><p></p><p>GAINING SAGE MODE</p><p>Gaining Sage Mode should be from a series of trials in which, players should be aware the potential death of their character could incur while grasping as this potential. This should not be something that is planned for during character creation, nor should it be handwaved with a second-hand explanation. Power of this magnitude should come from serious narrative complications and implications. Gaining Senjutsu is one that does not come from character choice, but is instead initiated by a Sage or Sage Beast from a Tribe the PC has grown close to. This requires the GM to initiate such an event as it is entirely out of the players hands. There are a few steps in between learning of the existence of Sage Mode and actually learning to harness it. While following each step of the process, you must first select one skill to focus on if more than one is listed. Be sure the skill selected is the skill you wish to focus on because once selected, you cannot go back and change this selection. Once selected, you must make the chosen skill check five times, and of these five checks, you must succeed at least three times. For each step in the process, you can cast one jutsu of your choice, once, to help you succeed one of the five checks. At the PC’s sole discretion, they can spend extra DT focusing on the current step. For each additional DT spent, they gain a +2 bonus to all of that step’s skill checks. If the PC fail any of the steps, they shinobi suffers the listed condition.</p><p>Failing Step 1: After failing to succeed the physically taxing portion of the Sage Training, the PC find themselves broken, bruised and with a shattered body. They require 4 DT to recover. Until all 4 DT to recover is spent, they have 3 ranks of Exhaustion;</p><p>Failing Step 2: After failing to grasp the concepts of Sage Arts and how to manipulate Nature Energy while using them, their mentor instructs them to take a break to recover an regroup. They cannot attempt to practice Senjutsu for 4 weeks (This does not cost DT).</p><p>Failing Step 3: After failing to recognize the differences between Nature Energy or other darker malevolent forces in the world, the PC’s body has become slightly corrupted by this mixed intake of Chakra. They lose the ability to Mold Chakra (CM). They require 4 DT of rest to recover. If they failed any of their skill checks by 10 or more, they lose the ability to Mold Chakra until healed by a Ninjutsu with the Medical keyword that removes Conditions, of A-Rank or higher.</p><p>Failing Step 4: After failing to correctly mold and mix the nature energy inside of their body, they lose themselves as their body converts into whatever creature or nature affinity they are most connected with while training. Their mentor is able to save them, but only as a onetime deal. Their mentor, nor can anyone else save the PC a second time. If they attempt and fail this step twice, they are lost as nature energy changes them beyond repair becoming one of the many beast tribes’ speechless tribesman or turning into a pure elemental spirit, lost to the world.</p><p></p><p>LEVELING UP SAGE MODE</p><p>Leveling up Sage mode is a difficult and time- consuming process. Unlike normal shinobi classes that</p><p>require the player to gain XP to reach their next level, Sage Mode requires the user to consistently train with the form, both in combat and through passive downtime training. But to do this a person would need to also assume the risks of potentially failing such a training process. At Character level 13, 15, 17, and 19, you can further your sage training to ascend to the next level of Senjutsu. Return to your tribes or mentors sage domain. When you do, you must redo steps 1-4, but reduce the number of checks made by 1. If the number of checks made would fall below the number of successes needed, you instead must succeed all checks made.</p><img src=\"systems/n5eb/assets/Icons%20%26%20Images/Cheat%20Sheet/Senjutsu%20Learning.png\" /><img src=\"systems/n5eb/assets/Icons%20%26%20Images/Cheat%20Sheet/Senjutsu%20Sage%20Mode.png\" />"

			"description": "<p>Your hair begins to flow on its own as if there is a strong breeze always near you. Your iris’s take the shape of a spiraling tornado as you gain tattoo’s on your arms and hands symbolic of the wind itself. The more chakra you have the more harmless wind you can generate. You gain the following Abilities and Passives.</p><p></p><p>WIND ABILITIES </p><p>• Once per turn, on your turn, you can spend 2 Sage Chakra to cast Wind Release: Blurring Wind at no action cost. If cast in this way, its duration becomes ‘Concentration, until dispelled or Sage Mode ends.’ Its effects can trigger twice per turn and works even if the target does not rely on sight or has Truesight. While maintaining concentration in this way, you do not spend Sage Chakra to maintain concentration on it. </p><p>• Once per turn, when you would cast a Jutsu or Senjutsu that deals wind damage or has the wind release keyword you can spend 3 Sage Chakra to sharpen or strengthen the wind to the point of manifesting Sage Breezes. A jutsu or Sage Art enhanced in this way doubles all ranks of Bleed it inflicts and then instead inflicts the target with Lacerated, the range of Swirl increases to 15 feet and spreads Mental conditions, and doubles the distance of knock back, if any.</p><p></p><p>WIND PASSIVE </p><p>• You have immunity to the Bleeding, Exhausted and Dazed Conditions. (Effects that inflict ranks of exhaustion that you use or activate still inflicts their ranks and imposes those effects as normal.) </p><p>• You can never suffer fall damage or effects that would cause fall damage like effects. </p><p>• Your unarmed and weapon damage types can be changed to Wind. </p><p>• Allied creatures who begin their turn within 5 feet of you that have ranks of an Elemental condition, reduce those ranks by an amount equal to your levels in this class mod, once per long rest.</p>"
